      "Digital wellness is about actively managing your relationship with technology to support your mental health, productivity, and social life. As an IIT student surrounded by screens—laptops for assignments, phones for messaging, online resources for study—it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or distracted. Strategies for digital wellness include establishing screen-free zones or hours, using website blockers or focus apps, and practicing mindful internet use. Take regular breaks from screens, avoid device use just before bed, and curate your social media for positivity. Combining these habits creates a healthier digital routine, reduces digital fatigue, and ensures technology supports rather than hinders your academic journey.",

      "Relaxation techniques help calm your mind and body, making it easier to manage stress and focus better on tough academic tasks. Mindfulness meditation is scientifically shown to reduce cortisol levels, sharpen attention, and boost mood—even with just 5–10 minutes a day. Try deep breathing exercises like 4-7-8 breathing or box breathing during study breaks, and practice progressive muscle relaxation before bed to improve sleep and recovery. Add mindful stretching, slow campus walks focusing on your senses, or visualize peaceful scenes during moments of tension. These habits not only ease anxiety but also strengthen your brain's capacity to handle pressure and uncertainty.",

    description:
      "Coping with anxiety at IIT means having tools to address both the root cause and your immediate feelings. Problem-focused strategies—like organizing your study plan, seeking support for academic doubts, or clarifying expectations with professors—help tackle stressors head-on. Emotion-focused strategies, such as the STOP technique (Stop, Take a breath, Observe, Proceed), cognitive reframing (shifting negative self-talk to growth statements), and grounding exercises (5-4-3-2-1 method), help manage racing thoughts and emotional overwhelm. Build your support system: connect with trusted friends, peer mentors, or counselors. Remember, everyone faces anxiety—using these science-backed tools regularly gives you back a sense of control.",

    description:
      "Scientific stress management blends mental, behavioral, and lifestyle approaches. Use cognitive-behavioral methods to catch negative thoughts early and reframe them into positive, actionable perspectives—like seeing a setback as a future improvement opportunity. Physical activities, from progressive muscle relaxation to regular exercise or yoga, help release tension and improve mood. Maintain good sleep hygiene: a cool, dark, and digital-free room, consistent bedtime, and limit caffeine after mid-day will improve night-time recovery. Proper nutrition—whole grains, nuts, vegetables, omega-3s—fuels your brain, while hydration and regular meals maintain energy and focus. Create a calm study environment, check in with yourself morning and evening, and plan weekly de-stressing routines to stay resilient.",

      "Building resilience is about assembling your personalized toolkit—a set of practical coping strategies ready for every situation. Create a 'menu' with three quick fixes (deep breathing, a short walk, or music), three medium strategies (calling a supportive friend, journaling stressors, mindful meditation), and three comprehensive resets (attending a workshop, engaging in creative art or club activities, or physically reorganizing your workspace). Schedule daily gratitude and intention-setting every morning, regular emotion check-ins midday, and self-reflection each evening. Practice reframing: view academic setbacks as learning moments, remind yourself of past successes, and tap into your campus support system when challenges feel too big. Adapting and reviewing your strategies weekly will keep you flexible and confident through every academic term.",
